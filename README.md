# House Price Range Prediction 

The **House Price Range Prediction (UK)** project utilizes data from the UK housing market spanning 1995 to 2023, provided by HM Land Registry. This project aims to predict future home price ranges, offering valuable insights to potential home buyers based on property attributes such as locality, postcode, district, and county. 

## Keywords

## Introduction
Navigating the intricacies of the United Kingdomâ€™s housing market is a daunting task for potential homebuyers. This project uses extensive data from HM Land Registry for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive models to empower individuals with precise insights, enabling informed decision-making and effective financial planning. 

## Previous Work
The landscape of real estate price prediction has been shaped by several notable studies. The HM Land Registry Open Data and Kaggle datasets have been instrumental in providing comprehensive datasets for predictive analysis. Noteworthy studies in real estate price forecasting have explored the effectiveness of machine learning methods.

## Methods
The project involves data collection from Kaggle, data preprocessing, encoding techniques, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. The models are evaluated based on recall, precision, and F1-score metrics.

## Results
The Random Forest model outperforms XGBoost in terms of accuracy and stability, making it the preferred choice for predicting housing market changes. The model shows promise for providing valuable insights to potential buyers and investors.

## Discussion
The project has made significant progress in real estate analysis, showcasing the power of data-driven decision-making. The Random Forest model's robustness and accuracy make it a promising tool for planning future investments in the real estate sector.
